# Next steps

* Fix the styleguide generation (KSS)
* Replace Gulp with NPM scripts. Scripts are in the `package.json` already, need work.
* Or/And use Webpack
* When generating component with the `yo drupal-theme:theme-component` command, check if component or js behavior already exists in the .libraries.yml file.
* Check and fix all Gulp and NPM scripts (f.x. `build:kss`)
